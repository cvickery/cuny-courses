# 2017-11-21: To copy the cuny_courses db from here to the cloud is complicated by the fact that
# Google App Engine (GAE) is running an older version of Postgres than I am running on babbage and
# cvlaptop. (Google: 9.6.1; Me: 10.1)

echo "Be sure pgproxy is stopped (look for 'No matching processes')..."
pgproxy stop

# No user associated with tables. On babbage and cvlaptop, vickery is the owner, but on GAE, the
# owner will be postgres.

# There are issues with restore_file that have to be fixed.
#   - The plpgsql extension is not owned by postgres on GAE, so commands related to that generate
#     errors. But they don't prevent a successful restore. This may change if triggers written in
#     plpgsql get written.
#   - In Postgres 10.1, the create sequence command has a new "AS <datatype>" clause that causes an
#     error when restoring to the 9.6.1 server on GAE. You have to delete those lines from
#     restore_file.

# Aside: There is an option to specify a directory for the dump, which might be more efficient. But
# the files generated are compressed, so it seems like less bother to use the default format, which
# produces more easily-edited output. The restore took only 17 seconds, so there's not much to be
# gained by generating the more efficient dump directory.

# To restore to the GAE:
#   Start the SQL proxy server, delete and recreate the db, and restore as user postgres:
