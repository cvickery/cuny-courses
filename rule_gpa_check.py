""" Report rules that overlap one-another or have gaps in their GPA requirements.
    Triggered by MA 114 from QCC to QNS, which says C- or below is blanket credit, but D or above

    For every source course, look at all rule groups it belongs to, and build a list of gpa ranges;

    The problem is that there are 1.6 million courses, and it takes 30" just to count them all.

#   Else add the tuple for this row to the list, and report any gaps/overlaps detected.
