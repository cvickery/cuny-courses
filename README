Updated the list of queries; there are twelve of them now.
The cron job is now set up to run the update_db script at noon on Tuesdays.
The Google Cloud Environment is no longer being used: the app is hosted on babbage using a gunicorn
server running there.

Here are the queries that run each Tuesday morning. The get_cuny command should be run as a cron job after
Tumbleweed receives the files, and then I need a script that extracts events, re-initializes the db,
restores the events and rule statuses, and updates the db in the Google App Engine.
